# GoogleMapPortfolio.js
A jQuery plugin that essentially generates the majority of a full online portfolio (of most any kind.. as long as each 'piece' has an image, and associated text). Currently in use at joshpope.com. 

*note*
For a v1 prod release - this implementation would need to be updated so you pass in the full data for each project during instantiation (which it WILL accept now without failure). However, for my personal needs and the limitations of my CMS- I am using a templating engine to populate the JS file with data. I fully realize this is not the "right" way to do it- but I also know that it works as well, hits same benchmarks, and I built my entire portfolio in less than 4 days. So for what it is, it works beautifully.
